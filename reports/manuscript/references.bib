However, studies show that fewer than 5\% of cancer patients are enrolled in any type of research study or clinical trial. Although there is a wide variety of reasons for the low participation rate, we address this issue by designing a chatbot to help users determine their eligibility via interactive, two-way communication. The chatbot is supported by a user-centered classifier that uses an active deep learning approach to separate complex eligibility criteria into questions that can be easily answered by users and information that requires verification by their doctors. We collected all the available clinical trial eligibility criteria from the National Cancer Institute's website to evaluate the chatbot and the classifier. Experimental results show that the active deep learning classifier outperforms the baseline k-nearest neighbor method. In addition, an in-person experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the chatbot. The results indicate that the participants who used the chatbot achieved better understanding about eligibility than those who used only the website. Furthermore, interfaces with chatbots were rated significantly better in terms of perceived usability, interactivity, and dialogue.},

	abstract = {We developed a model predicting the probability of success (PoS) for single planned or ongoing PhIII trials based on information available at trial initiation. Such a model is highly relevant for study sponsors to capture risk and opportunity on a trial to trial basis through trial optimization, and for investors to select drugs whose trial design match their investment strategy.
Objectives: To predict the outcome of planned or ongoing PhIII trials in oncology, given publicly available prior information
Design, Setting, Participants: Predictive modeling using publicly available data for 360 completed PhIII and 1240 PhII studies initiated between 2003 and 2012. Success and failure of PhIII studies were modeled using Bayesian logistic regression model.
Main Outcome Measures: Predicted PoS of individual PhIII trials based on a Bayesian model calibrated on publicly available data translated into 16 composite scores. Those scores cover aspects such as trial design, indication, number of patients, phase II (PhII) study outcomes, experience of sponsor at time of trial initiation, and others.
Results: The model allows to calculate the PoS distribution,  including credible intervals, for a PhIII trial in oncology. The predictive performance was determined using an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC), resulting in an overall performance of 73\%oPP (mean AUROC). We identified two key factors contributing to the predictive performance of the model: quality and strength of PhII data and experience of the sponsor at the time of study initiation. 
Conclusion and Relevance: We describe the generation and application of a statistical model predicting the PoS for individual PhIII trials in oncological indications with unprecedented predictive performance. Compared to other approaches, this is the first study generating a fully transparent model resulting in trial specific PoS distributions. Moreover, we have shown that qualitative concepts such as PhII knowledge or sponsor R\&D strength can be captured in quantitative scores and that these scores have a high predictive power.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE Drug development in oncology currently is facing a conjunction of an increasing number of antineoplastic agents (ANAs) candidate for phase I clinical trials (P1CTs) and an important attrition rate for ﬁnal approval. We aimed to develop a machine learning algorithm (RESOLVED2) to predict drug development outcome, which could support early go/no-go decisions after P1CTs by better selection of drugs suitable for further development.
METHODS PubMed abstracts of P1CTs reporting on ANAs were used together with pharmacologic data from the DrugBank5.0 database to model time to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (FDA approval-free survival) since the ﬁrst P1CT publication. The RESOLVED2 model was trained with machine learning methods. Its performance was evaluated on an independent test set with weighted concordance index (IPCW).
RESULTS We identiﬁed 462 ANAs from PubMed that matched with DrugBank5.0 (P1CT publication dates 1972 to 2017). Among 1,411 variables, 28 were used by RESOLVED2 to model the FDA approval-free survival, with an IPCW of 0.89 on the independent test set. RESOLVED2 outperformed a model that was based on efﬁcacy/toxicity (IPCW, 0.69). In the test set at 6 years of follow-up, 73\% (95\% CI, 49\% to 86\%) of drugs predicted to be approved were approved, whereas 92\% (95\% CI, 87\% to 98\%) of drugs predicted to be nonapproved were still not approved (log-rank P , .001). A predicted approved drug was 16 times more likely to be approved than a predicted nonapproved drug (hazard ratio, 16.4; 95\% CI, 8.40 to 32.2).
CONCLUSION As soon as P1CT completion, RESOLVED2 can predict accurately the time to FDA approval. We provide the proof of concept that drug development outcome can be predicted by machine learning strategies.},

	abstract = {Predicting drug-target interactions has gradually become a heated issue in medical research. However, identifying the drug-target interactions in clinical trials requires a lot of financial resources and time. More and more computational methods are currently used for drug-target interaction predictions. This paper proposes a drug-target interaction prediction method that can integrate information from different heterogeneous networks. This method constructs multiple drug and target similarity networks and applies the GraRep algorithm on the similarity networks after denoising in order to extract the features. Features obtained from heterogeneous networks are combined as a feature vector of DTIs, which is the input of Random Forest. The result of our experiment shows that our method in this paper increases the accuracy of prediction for DTIs, which is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches.},

This endeavor is challenging due to unique characteristics of multi-center trials including randomization schemes for multiple treatment arms, ﬁnite recruitment target (that is, across all sites, only a ﬁnite number of subjects need be satisﬁed) and uncertainty in recruitment rates, etc. Simulation has great potential for being the ideal tool which companies can utilize to make better decisions with considerations to both supply chain risks and costs. To achieve this goal, it is important to understand the speciﬁcs of clinical trial supply chains. Built upon this knowledge, our paper provides an advanced tutorial on modeling and practical considerations in clinical supply simulation.},

	abstract = {Clinical trials are crucial for the advancement of treatment and knowledge within the medical community. Since 2007, US federal government took the initiative and required organizations sponsoring clinical trials with at least one site in the United States to submit information on these clinical trials to the ClinicalTrials.gov database, resulting in a rich source of information for clinical trial research. Nevertheless, only a handful of analytic studies have been carried out to understand this valuable data source. In this study, we propose to use network analysis to understand infectious disease clinical trial research. Our goal is to answer two important questions: (1) what are the concentrations and characteristics of infectious disease clinical trial research? and (2) how to accurately predict what type of clinical trials a sponsor (or an investigator) are interested in? The answers to the first question provide effective ways to summarize clinical trial research related to particular disease(s), and the answers to the second question help match clinical trial sponsors and investigators for information recommendation. By using 4,228 clinical trials as the test bed, our study involves 4,864 sponsors and 1,879 research areas characterized by Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) keywords. We extract a set of network measures to show patterns of infectious disease clinical trials, and design a new community based link prediction approach to predict sponsors’ interests, with significant improvement compared to baselines. This trans-formative study concludes that using network analysis can tremendously help the understanding of clinical trial research for effective summarization, characterization, and prediction.},

	abstract = {A key driver in biopharmaceutical investment decisions is the probability of success of a drug development program. We estimate the probabilities of success (PoS) of clinical trials for vaccines and other anti-infective therapeutics using 43,414 unique triplets of clinical trial, drug, and disease between January 1, 2000, and January 7, 2020, yielding 2,544 vaccine programs and 6,829 non-vaccine programs targeting infectious diseases. The overall estimated PoS for an industry-sponsored vaccine program is 39.6\%, and 16.3\% for an industry-sponsored anti-infective therapeutic. Among industry-sponsored vaccines programs, only 12 out of 27 disease categories have seen at least one approval, with the most successful being against monkeypox (100\%), rotavirus (78.7\%), and Japanese encephalitis (67.6\%). The three infectious diseases with the highest PoS for industry-sponsored nonvaccine therapeutics are smallpox (100\%), CMV (31.8\%), and onychomycosis (29.8\%). Nonindustry-sponsored vaccine and non-vaccine development programs have lower overall PoSs: 6.8\% and 8.2\%, respectively. Viruses involved in recent outbreaks—MERS, SARS, Ebola, Zika—have had a combined total of only 45 non-vaccine development programs initiated over the past two decades, and no approved therapy to date (Note: our data was obtained just before the COVID-19 outbreak and do not contain information about the programs targeting this disease.) These estimates offer guidance both to biopharma investors as well as to policymakers seeking to identify areas most likely to be undeserved by private-sector engagement and in need of public-sector support.},

Our regression analysis showed that studies with progression-free survival or response rate as primary endpoint were more likely to succeed than studies with overall survival (odds ratio (OR)=2.94 and 6.23, respectively). The status of development was also linked with success rates. Studies for non-lead indication tended to have lower success rates than studies for lead indication (OR=0.68). Studies for first-line therapy were observed to have low success rates compared with studies for post second-line therapies (OR=0.37). Studies for which strong prior evidence was not listed in their publication tended to be more successful than studies that followed rigorous RCTs or single arm studies for the indication. These results suggest that historical success rates may reflect not only the important features of trials, which can be observed directly from study design and results, but also the background status of trials in clinical development pathways.},

	abstract = {The current success rate of a drug candidate, from the beginning of the clinical trial to receiving marketing approval, is about 10\%–2­ 0\%, and it has not changed during the past few decades. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies are under pressure to select one compound, among many others, with a high probability of success. The differences in drug features affect their probabilities of approval success. In this study, we examined the approval success rates of drug candidates, developed in the United States, the European Union, or Japan, by focusing on four parameters (“drug target,” “drug action,” “drug modality,” and “drug application”) and their combinations, and identified factors that conditioned the outcome of the drug development process. We obtained a total success rate of 12.8\%, after evaluating 3999 compounds. Moreover, after analyzing the combinations of these parameters, the approval success rates of drugs that corresponded to the following categories—­a stimulant in drug action or an enzyme in drug target and biologics (excluding monoclonal antibody) in drug modality—­were high (34.1\% and 31.3\%, respectively). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that stimulant in drug action, and “B” (blood and blood forming organs), “G” (genito-u­ rinary system and sex), and “J” (anti-i­nfectives for systemic use) in drug application were statistically associated with high approval success rates. We found several parameters and their combinations that affected drug approval success rates. Our results could assist pharmaceutical companies in evaluating the probability of success of their drug candidates and, thus, in efficiently conducting the clinical development process.},

The simulation model utilizes available data about each drug/indication in the industry R\&D pipeline, and transforms it into a set of metrics characterizing future industry performance. Industry-wide portfolio simulation model was developed to address short- and longterm portfolio productivity forecasting challenges. The model is drug–centric, it simulates drug development work ow process. The model also incorporates multiple business rules related to drugs interdependence. The model predicted 2016 drop in NME approvals based on 2014 data.

	abstract = {Background:  Studies on the early 2000s documented increasing attrition rates and duration of clinical trials, leading to a representation of a “productivity crisis” in pharmaceutical research and development (R\&D). In this paper, we produce a new set of analyses for the last decade and report a recent increase of R\&D productivity within the industry.
Methods:  We use an extensive data set on the development history of more than 50,000 projects between 1990 and 2017, which we integrate with data on sales, patents, and anagraphical information on each institution involved. We devise an indicator to quantify the novelty of each project, based on its set of mechanisms of action.
Results:  First, we investigate how R\&D projects are allocated across therapeutic areas and find a polarization towards high uncertainty/high potential reward indications, with a strong focus on oncology. Second, we find that attrition rates have been decreasing at all stages of clinical research in recent years. In parallel, for each phase, we observe a significant reduction of time required to identify projects to be discontinued. Moreover, our analysis shows that more recent successful R\&D projects are increasingly based on novel mechanisms of action and target novel indications, which are characterized by relatively small patient populations. Third, we find that the number of R\&D projects on advanced therapies is also growing. Finally, we investigate the relative contribution to productivity variations of different types of institutions along the drug development process, with a specific focus on the distinction between the roles of Originators and Developers of R\&D projects. We document that in the last decade Originator–Developer collaborations in which biotech companies act as Developers have been growing in importance. Moreover, we show that biotechnology companies have reached levels of productivity in project development that are equivalent to those of large pharmaceutical companies.
Conclusions:  Our study reports on the state of R\&D productivity in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, finding several signals of an improving performance, with R\&D projects becoming more targeted and novel in terms of indications and mechanisms of action.},

	abstract = {Predicting Phase 3 clinical trial results is a critical step of Go/No-Go decision making and Phase 3 trial design optimization. To predict the overall treatment eﬀect for patients enrolled into a Phase 3 trial, we propose a framework consisting of two models. First, an individual trough pharmacokinetic concentration (Ctrough) model is developed to predict the trough pharmacokinetic concentration for a potentially new treatment regime planned for Phase 3. Second, an individual treatment eﬀect model is built to model the relationship between patient baseline characteristics, Ctrough and clinical outcomes. These two models are combined together to predict Phase 3 clinical trial results. Since the clinical outcomes to be predicted are longitudinal and the predictors are a mix of time-invariant and timevariant variables, a novel neural network, Residual Semi-Recurrent Neural Network, is developed for both models. The proposed framework is applied in a post-hoc prediction of Phase 3 clinical trial results, and it outperforms the traditional method.},

	abstract = {The opportunity cost of the capital invested in pharmaceutical research and development (R\&D) to bring a new drug to market makes up as much as half the total cost. However, the literature on the cost of pharmaceutical R\&D is mixed on how, exactly, one should calculate this “hidden” cost. Some authors attempt to adopt models from the field of finance, whereas other prominent authors dismiss this practice as biased, arguing that it artificially inflates the R\&D cost to justify higher prices for pharmaceuticals. In this article, we examine the arguments made by both sides of the debate and then explain the cost of capital concept and describe in detail how this value is calculated. Given the significant contribution of the cost of capital to the overall cost of new drug R\&D, a clear understanding of the concept is critical for policy makers, investors, and those involved directly in the R\&D.},

To understand the attrition of drugs through the regulatory process, here we review and advance machine-learning (ML) and natural language-processing algorithms to investigate the importance of factors in clinical trials that are linked with failure in Phases II and III. We find that clinical trial phase transitions can be predicted with an average accuracy of 80\%. Identifying these trials provides information to sponsors facing difficult decisions about whether these higher risk trials should be modified or halted. We also find common protocol characteristics across therapeutic areas that are linked to phase success, including the number of endpoints and the complexity of the eligibility criteria.},

	abstract = {The biopharmaceutical industry is facing unprecedented challenges to its fundamental business model and currently cannot sustain sufficient innovation to replace its products and revenues lost due to patent expirations.The number of truly innovative new medicines approved by regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration has declined substantially despite continued increases in R\&D spending, raising the current cost of each new molecular entity (NME) to approximately US\$1.8 billionDeclining R\&D productivity is arguably the most important challenge the industry faces and thus improving R\&D productivity is its most important priority.A detailed analysis of the key elements that determine overall R\&D productivity and the cost to successfully develop an NME reveals exactly where (and to what degree) R\&D productivity can (and must) be improved.Reducing late-stage (Phase II and III) attrition rates and cycle times during drug development are among the key requirements for improving R\&D productivity.To achieve the necessary increase in R\&D productivity, R\&D investments, both financial and intellectual, must be focused on the 'sweet spot' of drug discovery and early clinical development, from target selection to clinical proof-of-concept.The transformation from a traditional biopharmaceutical FIPCo (fully integrated pharmaceutical company) to a FIPNet (fully integrated pharmaceutical network) should allow a given R\&D organization to 'play bigger than its size' and to more affordably fund the necessary number and quality of pipeline assets.},

            DrugCentral is a public resource (http://drugcentral.org) that serves the scientific community by providing up-to-date drug information, as described in previous papers. The current release includes 109 newly approved (October 2018 through March 2020) active pharmaceutical ingredients in the US, Europe, Japan and other countries; and two molecular entities (e.g. mefuparib) of interest for COVID19. New additions include a set of pharmacokinetic properties for ∼1000 drugs, and a sex-based separation of side effects, processed from FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System); as well as a drug repositioning prioritization scheme based on the market availability and intellectual property rights forFDA approved drugs. In the context of the COVID19 pandemic, we also incorporated REDIAL-2020, a machine learning platform that estimates anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, as well as the ‘drugs in news’ feature offers a brief enumeration of the most interesting drugs at the present moment. The full database dump and data files are available for download from the DrugCentral web portal.},
